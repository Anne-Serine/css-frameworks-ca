Description

I created 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS.

The authentication page have a form to login or register to the application. IÂ´ve included HTML form validation and uses /profile as the action attribute. Password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.

The feed page has a list of posts thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post.

The profile page has a profile image, username, list of user posts, follow button and an area to display following/followers.

    Profile page ( profile.html )
    Feed page ( feed.html )
